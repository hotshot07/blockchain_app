# Basic Blockchian App

This is the app that I made at the end of my summer research internship at UIET, Chandigarh.

I used HTML and CSS for making the frontend and used the truffle suite for making the blockchain backend.
Web3JS, a JavaScript libaray is used to make the web app interact with the blockchian. 

This blockchian app takes a string entered by the user and stores it on the local blockchian(Ganche).
Then the string is retrived and shown on the webpage.
